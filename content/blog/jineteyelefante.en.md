The reason why I've chosen the image of a man on the back of an elephant as the logo for this blog is not something accidental.
When I read this analogy for the first time, it seemed like a comparison that, in addition to being simple, was quite useful for explaining and dealing with certain everyday situations.

It was in the book "Superpowers for normal people" by Mago More, (who in turn extracted it from another author). I'll talk more about this book by More in another post, because it really deserves it. Now I am going to tell what teaching underlies the story of the elephant and its rider.

The basis of all this is that all of us have an emotional side and a rational side that many times do not match. As a demonstration, simply try to start your diet the day you go to eat at that incredible dessert place.

The **rational and conscious** side of the mind (<mark> Rider </mark>) is the one that thinks and analyzes reality looking to the future. He is in charge of thinking long-term, reflecting and planning in pursuit of his goals, he knows where you should go.

The **instinctual** side of the mind (<mark> Elephant </mark>) is moved by emotions, seeking to minimize pain and maximize the most immediate pleasure. He is lazy and capricious and prefers immediate gratification (resting, eating poorly, continuing to smoke ...) to strive for long-term results (exercise, quitting smoking ...). Emotions are your domain, both the good and the bad.

The Elephant is big, strong, and impulsive, and the Rider is smart but small and weak.

Due to his intelligence, the Rider knows how to position himself on the back of the Elephant to direct it, he takes the reins but his control is weak ... If the elephant runs out of control for any reason, it is unlikely that the rider will be able to get hold of it.

When you know that you have to do something that you do not feel like doing, it is your rider who orders it. But moving the mastodon is not an easy task: it will look for a thousand excuses and "better" things to do. That's when the rider has trouble.

You can watch this show up close any day you have to get up early. Getting an elephant out of bed by hand is not an easy task ...
Or when you try to quit smoking and someone offers you.
Or when you don't feel like going for a run.

I mean, everyday...

Of course, when the elephant finds an emotional motive to move ("motivation"), the rider's task is easier. But generally, we must use willpower, which is difficult and ends up exhausting the rider.

I am not a defender of motivation, since it is usually something temporary and emotional (in another post I will go into more detail). It seems to me that it works in the short term but we cannot delegate to it, hoping to always be motivated.

This blog tries (among other things) to find strategies so that the rider and the elephant work as coordinated as possible, and ultimately, our rider is as robust as possible and the Elephant collaborates on the emotional side.

- Strengthen the Rider: For this, we need to be clear about what we want, and a certain mental balance.
- Convince the Elephant: We will try to align our emotions so that they play in our favor and not against us.
- Pave the way: If we prepare the environment we will make the change easier for both the Rider and the Elephant.

I will be counting what techniques I try to advance in this objective.

See you soon!
